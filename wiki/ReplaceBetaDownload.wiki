#Instructions for when you want to replace the 'Beta' download with a newer version

= Steps =

  * Make a copy of the local (up-to-date) folder that houses the GetSimple development version on your computer. 
  * Download and run [http://code.google.com/p/get-simple-cms/downloads/list NoSVN.exe] on that folder. This executable gets rid of  all the SVN specific files that do not need to be included in the download.
  * Zip up that folder with the name format: `GetSimple_X.XB_rXXX.zip`
  * Upload this new zip file to the [http://code.google.com/p/get-simple-cms/downloads/list downloads] section of our Google Code project using the same naming convention: `GetSimple X.X Beta - rXXX`. Give this new download two new tags: 'Beta' & 'Featured'
